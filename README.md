# Lexicon-Encoding-and-Decoding

The core files of the BabblED are contained here. These programs allow the creation of a DNA lexicon from a text file supplied by the user. This can then be used to create DNA sentences of BabbleBlocks. Once sequencing data from a BabbleBlock is returned and loaded into the decoding program the stored information is returned.
